Folder browser for Solid file system: traverse, add new folders, objects, upload files etc

This version of a folder viewer is a table view with a list of files and attributes in columns

- There is a breadcrumbs list at the top of the ancestor folders.
  -- You can click on one to go there
  -- You can drag one eg into the browser new tab space to open in a new tab

-- Files in lists have icons which can be dragged or clicked on
-- Files in the list have names which can be clicked on
-- Files n lists have size and date fields which are passive read only

A "more" icons "..." allows use of a social toolbar for each file.

The toolbar allows logged-in individuals to perform various extensible social actions on the files and folders in the list.
